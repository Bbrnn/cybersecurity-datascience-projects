# Cybersecurity and Data Science Projects

Welcome to the **Cybersecurity and Data Science Projects** repository! This repository contains a collection of projects that I want to do that explore the intersection of cybersecurity and data science. The aim is to leverage data science techniques to enhance cybersecurity practices and solutions. If you'd like to collaborate just find my contact below and we could collaborate

## Projects Overview

### 1. **Automated Phishing Detection System**
   - **Description:** Develop a system to identify and block phishing attempts using machine learning.
   - **Technologies:** Python, NLP, scikit-learn
   - **Datasets:** [Phishing Email Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
   - **Reasoning:** Phishing detection involves text classification, which is a fundamental machine learning task. This project is relatively straightforward as it focuses on handling and classifying text data.

### 2. **Fraud Detection System**
   - **Description:** Detect fraudulent activities in financial transactions using machine learning.
   - **Technologies:** Python, scikit-learn, TensorFlow
   - **Datasets:** [Financial Fraud Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
   - **Reasoning:** Fraud detection also involves classification but can be more complex due to the need to handle imbalanced datasets and various feature engineering tasks.

### 3. **Malware Detection Using Behavioral Analysis**
   - **Description:** Build a system that detects malware based on its behavior.
   - **Technologies:** Python, TensorFlow, Keras
   - **Datasets:** [CICIDS Malware Dataset](https://www.cic-ids.com/)
   - **Reasoning:** Behavioral analysis adds complexity as it requires handling and analyzing dynamic behavioral data, which can be more challenging than static text or tabular data.

### 4. **User Behavior Analytics (UBA) System**
   - **Description:** Analyze user behavior patterns to detect insider threats.
   - **Technologies:** Python, scikit-learn, Matplotlib
   - **Datasets:** [User Behavior Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
   - **Reasoning:** This involves analyzing complex behavior patterns and detecting anomalies, which can be more challenging due to the need for advanced anomaly detection techniques.

### 5. **Intrusion Detection System with Machine Learning**
   - **Description:** Develop an IDS using machine learning algorithms to detect anomalies in network traffic.
   - **Technologies:** Python, scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
   - **Datasets:** [CICIDS 2017](https://www.cic-ids.com/)
   - **Reasoning:** Network traffic analysis requires handling large datasets and extracting features, which introduces additional complexity compared to simpler classification tasks.

### 6. **Automated Vulnerability Assessment Tool**
   - **Description:** Combine vulnerability scanning with machine learning to prioritize vulnerabilities.
   - **Technologies:** Python, Vulnerability Scanners, scikit-learn
   - **Datasets:** [Vulnerability Dataset](https://nvd.nist.gov/)
   - **Reasoning:** This involves integrating vulnerability data with machine learning, which requires a deeper understanding of both security and data science.

### 7. **Network Traffic Analysis and Visualization Tool**
   - **Description:** Create a tool to analyze and visualize network traffic data.
   - **Technologies:** Python, Matplotlib, Grafana
   - **Datasets:** [CICIDS 2018](https://www.cic-ids.com/)
   - **Reasoning:** This project involves both data analysis and visualization, adding complexity due to the need for real-time data processing and visualization.

### 8. **Security Incident Analysis and Prediction**
   - **Description:** Analyze past security incidents to predict future threats.
   - **Technologies:** Python, Machine Learning, Pandas
   - **Datasets:** [CVE Details](https://www.cvedetails.com/)
   - **Reasoning:** Predicting future threats based on historical data requires sophisticated modeling and understanding of incident patterns, making this a more complex project.

### 9. **Cyber Threat Hunting with Data Analytics**
   - **Description:** Proactively search for hidden threats using data analytics.
   - **Technologies:** Python, Elasticsearch, Kibana
   - **Datasets:** [Network Traffic Dataset](https://www.cic-ids.com/)
   - **Reasoning:** Threat hunting involves complex data analysis and visualization, often requiring advanced techniques and tools to identify and understand hidden threats.

### 10. **Threat Intelligence Platform**
  - **Description:** Create a platform to collect, analyze, and visualize threat intelligence data.
  - **Technologies:** Python, Flask, D3.js, PostgreSQL
  -  **Datasets:** [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/), [OpenThreat Research](https://www.openthreatresearch.org/)
  -  **Reasoning:** Building a comprehensive platform involves integrating various components (data collection, analysis, visualization) and handling complex data sources, making it the most complex project.   -
