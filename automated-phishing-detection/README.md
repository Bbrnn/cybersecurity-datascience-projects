## Project Description

The system focuses on detecting phishing emails by classifying them using a machine learning model. The project includes preprocessing text data, training various models, and evaluating their performance. 

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for implementing the model.
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for model training and evaluation.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Numerical operations.
- **NLTK**: Natural Language Toolkit for text processing.
- **Flask**: For creating a web interface for model deployment.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You will also need to install the following libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn nltk matplotlib flask
```

### Cloning the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/automated-phishing-detection.git
cd automated-phishing-detection
```

### Dataset

Download the phishing email dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) and place it in the `data` directory of the project.

## Data Preparation

Load and preprocess the dataset using the provided scripts. This involves:

1. Loading the dataset.
2. Tokenizing and vectorizing the text data.
3. Splitting the data into training and testing sets.

## Model Training

Train the machine learning model using the preprocessed data. The project includes scripts for:

1. Training various models such as Support Vector Machine (SVM).
2. Evaluating the models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Evaluation

Evaluate the model performance using metrics and confusion matrix. Visualization tools such as Matplotlib and Seaborn are used to generate the confusion matrix and other evaluation metrics.

## Deployment

Deploy the trained model using Flask. The project includes a basic Flask application for serving predictions. 

**Example usage:**

```bash
python app.py
```

**Endpoint:** `/predict`

**Request format:**

```json
{
  "email_text": "Sample email content here."
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "prediction": "Phishing"
}
```
